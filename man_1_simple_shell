.SH NAME
holberton_simple_shell \- a simple Unix command-line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B holberton_simple_shell
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B holberton_simple_shell
is an interactive and non-interactive shell developed by Aurèle and Joséphine.
.br  
It allows users to execute system commands by reading user input,
.br
parsing the commands, and running them in child processes.

The shell operates in two modes:
.br  
- **Interactive mode**: Displays a prompt and waits for user input.
.br  
- **Non-interactive mode**: Reads and executes commands from a file or a pipeline.

This shell was implemented as part of the Holberton School curriculum
.br
to learn the fundamentals of system calls and process management.

.SH PATH
The shell uses the \fIPATH\fR environment variable to locate executables.
.br
